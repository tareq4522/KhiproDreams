The HD Roads package supports both HDRP and URP

Make sure to first import the full package and afterwards the required SRP package. 

The SRP version imported in your project can be found and updated in:

Window > Package Manager


HDRP NOTE: 

for all newer versions starting at HD SRP v6.9+ please first remove the following two shaders before importing the SRP package:

/Assets/NatureManufacture/HD Roads/Shaders/Standard_Metallic_Road_Shader_Parallax
/Assets/NatureManufacture/HD Roads/Shaders/Standard_Metallic_Cross_Road_Shader_Parallax
