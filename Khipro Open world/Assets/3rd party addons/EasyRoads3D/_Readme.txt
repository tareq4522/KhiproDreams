This package includes the EasyRoads3D demo scene and EasyRoads3D Pro tool.

It is recommended to import it in a new project first. Or it can be imported in your project if you want to use all assets. Otherwise assets can be exported / imported. 

It includes featured zones with links to tutorials on our website, http://easyroads3d.com/tutorials.php. 

The demo project also includes a variety of different road types and side objects which can be used in your own personal and commercial projects except for asset store packages. 

Please contact us for permission to use these assets in Unity asset store packages or for example open source Unity projects.   

Upon request the legacy provisional v3 beta demo project is part of the demo project as a separate Unity package.
